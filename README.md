# Heat Sink Temperature Distribution

**Course:** ME-495 Experimental Methods in the Thermal Sciences

**Completed:** Spring 2021

**Team members:** Skyler Penny, Connor Schmerfeld, Zachary Small

**Grade:**
  - ME-495 Report: 92%
  - ME-450 Report: 95%

***Note:** This course was completed in the same semester as ME-450 (Heat Transfer) which featured a similar project assigned around the same time. The instructors for both courses encouraged "double-dipping" of the project, using the same experimental setup from the ME-495 project to drive the analysis of the ME-450 project. I have included here the final reports for both the ME-495 project (completed as a group of four, as indicated above) and the ME-450 project (completed individually).*
